# 🌟 **Spring Core: IOC, DI & Beans**

**Goal:** Understand how Spring manages objects and why dependency injection is important.

---

# 🟦 **1. What is a Java Object? (Beginner Recap)**

In Java, we normally create objects like:

```java
Student s = new Student();
```

When projects grow, object creation becomes very difficult to manage.

Example:

* 10 services
* 50 repositories
* Multiple dependencies

Managing everything manually becomes a headache.

---

# 🟩 **2. What is a Dependency? (Very Simple)**

A **dependency** is something that a class needs to work.

Example:

* A **Car** depends on an **Engine**.
* A **StudentService** depends on **StudentRepository**.

Normal way:

```java
Engine e = new Engine();
Car c = new Car(e);
```

As application grows → very difficult to manage.

---

# 🟧 **3. What is IOC (Inversion of Control)?**

### **Simple Meaning:**

Normally, programmer creates objects.
But in Spring, **Spring Container creates objects**.

Control goes from programmer → Spring.

### Without IOC:

* You create objects
* You manage dependencies

### With IOC:

* Spring creates objects
* Spring injects dependencies
* Spring manages their life

---

# 🟥 **4. What is DI (Dependency Injection)?**

### **Definition:**

Spring **automatically injects required objects** into another object.

### Why DI?

* Reduces code
* No manual object creation
* Makes application flexible
* Easy for testing

---

# 🟦 **5. What is a Spring Bean?**

Any object created and managed by Spring Container is called a **Bean**.

Spring creates beans for classes annotated with:

* @Component
* @Service
* @Repository
* @Controller

Example:

```java
@Service
public class StudentService {
}
```

Spring will automatically create object of StudentService.

---

# 🟩 **6. Annotations That Create Beans (Beginner Level)**

### **@Component**

General class

### **@Service**

Business logic class

### **@Repository**

Database class

### **@Controller / @RestController**

API class

All these are beans → Spring manages them.

---

# 🟧 **7. Constructor Injection (Recommended)**

### Why?

* Best practice
* Easy to test
* Avoids null values

### Example:

#### **Repository**

```java
@Repository
public class StudentRepository {

    public String getStudent() {
        return "Vijay";
    }
}
```

#### **Service**

```java
@Service
public class StudentService {

    private final StudentRepository repo;

    public StudentService(StudentRepository repo) {  // DI here
        this.repo = repo;
    }

    public String getStudentName() {
        return repo.getStudent();
    }
}
```

#### **Controller**

```java
@RestController
public class StudentController {

    private final StudentService service;

    public StudentController(StudentService service) {  // DI here
        this.service = service;
    }

    @GetMapping("/student")
    public String getStudent() {
        return service.getStudentName();
    }
}
```

### Flow:

```
Controller → Service → Repository
(All are injected automatically)
```

---

# 🟥 **8. Setter Injection (Optional)**

Example:

```java
@Service
public class DemoService {

    private DemoRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public void setRepo(DemoRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
```

Setter injection is optional but used when dependencies change dynamically.

---

# 🟫 **9. Field Injection (Not Recommended)**

```java
@Autowired
private StudentRepository repo;
```

### Why not recommended?

* Hard to test
* Cannot use final keyword
* Not good for large systems

---

# 🟩 **10. @Autowired – Simple Explanation**

@Autowired tells Spring:

👉 “Please give me the object of this class.”

Spring checks container → finds the bean → injects automatically.

---

# 🟦 **11. Custom Bean using @Configuration + @Bean**

### Create a config class:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public String welcomeMessage() {
        return "Hello from Spring Bean!";
    }
}
```

### Use it in Controller:

```java
@Autowired
private String welcomeMessage;
```

---

# ⭐ **12. Small Mini Project (Beginner Level)**

Create 3 files:

---

### **TeacherRepository.java**

```java
@Repository
public class TeacherRepository {
    public String getTeacher() {
        return "Ramesh";
    }
}
```

---

### **TeacherService.java**

```java
@Service
public class TeacherService {

    private final TeacherRepository repo;

    public TeacherService(TeacherRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }

    public String fetchTeacher() {
        return repo.getTeacher();
    }
}
```

---

### **TeacherController.java**

```java
@RestController
public class TeacherController {

    private final TeacherService service;

    public TeacherController(TeacherService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    @GetMapping("/teacher")
    public String getTeacher() {
        return service.fetchTeacher();
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Teacher name is Ramesh
```

---

# 📝 **Assignments for Students**

### **Task 1: Course Module**

* CourseRepository → `getCourse() = "Java Full Stack"`
* CourseService → call repository
* CourseController → show on `/course`

Expected Output:

```
Course name is Java Full Stack
```

---

### **Task 2: Custom Bean**

Create a @Bean with message:

```
"Spring Boot Beans are Working!"
```

Inject and display in a controller.
