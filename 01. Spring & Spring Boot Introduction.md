# 🌟 **Spring & Spring Boot Introduction**

**Goal:** Understand what Spring is, why it is used, and create first Spring Boot project.

---

# 🟦 **1. What is Software Development? (Beginner explanation)**

Before learning Spring Boot, students must understand **how applications are built**.

### A software application has:

* **Frontend** → what user sees (UI)
* **Backend** → logic, database operations
* **Database** → stores data (MySQL, Oracle)

Spring Boot is used to build the **backend**.

---

# 🟩 **2. What is Java Framework?**

A **framework** is a set of tools and libraries that helps developers write applications easily.

Without framework = write everything manually.
With framework = things are done automatically.

---

# 🟧 **3. What is Spring Framework? (Very simple)**

Spring is a **Java framework** used to build:

✔ Web Applications
✔ REST APIs
✔ Enterprise Applications
✔ Microservices

### Why Spring?

* Reduces code
* Easy to maintain
* Provides security
* Connects to databases easily
* Very popular in IT industry

---

# 🟥 **4. Problems in Normal Java (Before Spring)**

In normal Java applications, developers must:

❌ Create objects manually
❌ Handle dependencies manually
❌ Write too many lines of code
❌ No built-in server
❌ No security layer

### Example:

```java
Car car = new Car();
car.start();
```

We create objects → **we control everything** → difficult to manage in big applications.

---

# 🟦 **5. How Spring Solves Problem (IOC + DI)**

Spring introduces:

### **IOC (Inversion of Control)**

Spring creates and manages objects (beans), not the developer.

### **DI (Dependency Injection)**

Spring automatically injects required objects.

So developers write less code → Spring manages the rest.

---

# 🟨 **6. What is Spring Boot? (Beginner Explanation)**

Spring Boot is an **advanced version of Spring** that provides:

✔ Auto-configuration
✔ In-built server (Tomcat)
✔ Ready-made project structure
✔ Less configuration
✔ Fast development
✔ Production-ready features

### Example:

Normal Spring = we must write boilerplate code
Spring Boot = everything is done automatically

---

# 🟩 **7. Benefits of Spring Boot (Easy Points)**

* Very simple setup
* No XML configuration
* Embedded server → no need to install Tomcat
* Can create API in 1 minute
* Very fast development
* Used for Microservices

---

# 🟫 **8. Monolithic vs Microservices (Simple)**

### **Monolithic Application**

* Entire project = single application
* If one part fails → whole app affected
* Hard to scale

### **Microservices**

* Application is divided into small independent services
* Each service handles one feature
* Easy to scale
* Spring Boot is the base for microservices

Example:
E-commerce app:

* Product service
* Cart service
* Payment service
* Order service
  (All separate microservices)

---

# 🟦 **9. Installing Required Tools (Beginner Friendly)**

Ask students to install:

1. **Java JDK 17+**
2. **Maven**
3. **Postman**
4. **Spring Tool Suite (STS)** or IntelliJ
5. **MySQL Workbench**

Explain:

* Java is the language
* Spring Boot uses Maven
* Postman is for API testing
* STS/IntelliJ is for coding

---

# 🟩 **10. Creating First Spring Boot Project (Step-by-step)**

### **Step 1: Go to**

[https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)

### **Step 2: Select**

* **Project:** Maven
* **Language:** Java
* **Spring Boot Version:** latest
* **Dependencies:** Spring Web

### **Step 3: Download and open it in IDE**

---

# 🟧 **11. Understanding Project Structure (Beginner Friendly)**

### 📁 **src/main/java**

Write Java code (Controllers, Services, etc.)

### 📁 **src/main/resources**

Contains:

* application.properties
* static (HTML, CSS)
* templates (Thymeleaf)

### 📄 **pom.xml**

Contains project dependencies.

---

# 🟥 **12. Main Class Explanation**

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### @SpringBootApplication =

* @Configuration
* @EnableAutoConfiguration
* @ComponentScan

This makes Spring Boot **scan and load** entire application.

---

# 🟦 **13. Running Application**

Click **Run** → application starts on port **8080**.

### Log shows:

```
Tomcat started on port 8080
Started DemoApplication
```

Congratulations → Your first Spring Boot app is running! 🎉

---

# 🟧 **14. Creating First API (Beginner Level Code)**

### HelloController.java

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Welcome to Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

### Test URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/hello
```

---

# 🟦 **15. Student Assignments**

Ask students to create:

### **Assignment 1: /info API**

Return:

```
This is Spring Boot Training
```

### **Assignment 2: /welcome API**

Return:

```
Welcome Students to Spring Boot!
```

### **Assignment 3: Change server port to 9090**

Add in application.properties:

```
server.port=9090
```
